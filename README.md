# Data-Wrangling-Project
In this project, I assessed and cleaned the transactions and customers data of a group of stores using Python.

I took care of the following tidinessÂ  and dirtiness issues in the datasets before merging them as needed for further analysis:

1. Changed all column names to lowercase for ease of coding.
2. Removed duplicates
3. Extracted data from a column and created two new columns for the extracted data points.
4. Dropped unwanted column
5. Changed column data type.
6. Removed outliers.
7. Renamed columns to represent the column content better.
8. Merged data frames and saved data.
